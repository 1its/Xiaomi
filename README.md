The devices are difficult to get paired initially. Plenty of information https://community.smartthings.com/t/original-aqara-xiaomi-zigbee-sensors-contact-temp-motion-button-outlet-leak-etc/113253/1

<b>Great devices but I personally do not recommend the outlets as they appear to make my system less stable. However, other people do not seem to report this.<b>
